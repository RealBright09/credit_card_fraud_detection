Credit Card Fraud Detection Model in Python

In this project, we'll build a credit card fraud detection model using Python. The model is designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions from a dataset. To follow along, you'll need to download the dataset from this Kaggle link (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download).

The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with a mix of fraudulent and legitimate transactions. We'll use various machine learning techniques to train the model and evaluate its performance. By the end of this project, you'll have a strong understanding of how to approach fraud detection using real-world data.
